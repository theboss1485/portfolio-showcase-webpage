            <p>I am a graduate of Liberty University Online with a degree in Information Technology: Application and Database Development.
                I live in Ohio in the USA with my family.  I am the oldest of three siblings and have one brother and one sister.
                I am preparing to get a software development job by going to the OSU Web Development bootcamp.  After I acquire a higher-paying
                job, I would like to move into my own house, get married, and start a family.
            </p>

        <!-- The Work section contains the images of projects.  When clicking on a project that I have built, the user will be taken to the 
        deployed webpage for that project.  Note that the link to the portfolio showcase leads to the webpage that the user is alread on.
        Projects 3 through 5 lead to empty GitHub repositories as of now, because I haven't built those projects yet. -->
